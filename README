A tiny html widget for time tracking for basecamp projects.

The goal of this application is to provide an embeddable 
html page, for tracking a day tasks with basecamp.

You can acess it on:

   http://bc-timer.heroku.com/

It will prompt you for a basecamp domain and api token
You can obtain the token from the bottom of your profile page on basecamp.

If you provide a basecamp domain on the URI, it will only prompt for the token

    http://bc-timer.heroku.com/mycompany

If you provide the token, the app wil auto login. 

    http://bc-timer.heorku.com/mycomany/xxxxxxx

To add this app as a gmail gadget, just append /gmail.xml to the uri.
And add that to your gmail account.

   http://bc-timer.heroku.com/mycompany/xxxxx/gmail.xml
